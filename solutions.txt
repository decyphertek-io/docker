1. FlatCat Linux LTS
2. Ignition sets hostname and active docker
3. Manually download docker-compose 
4. Setup Portainer. 
5. Decide the server type
6. Create a startup script , either interactive or automatic to set passwords. 
7. Make those passwords accessible if possible. 


# Issues
* Need servers to be self signed encrypted. I need to setup nginx, cadddy or traefik. 
* Startup script currently fails as interactive.
